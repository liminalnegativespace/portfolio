### (not) artist statement

As a content creator, I believe that visual arts is a powerful alternative to verbal communication and it can be a tool that the silenced, the erased, and the non-native speakers of the dominant language in a particular society can take advantage of. 

When creating my works, I draw from my own experiences as a Chinese-born individual navigating a both privileged and marginalized existence across multiple countries and cultures, and I view my creative process as at once interrogating and liberating, both personally and politically speaking.

**以上我自己也不信。**
