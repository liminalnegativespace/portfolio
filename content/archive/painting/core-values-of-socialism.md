### Second round of crackdown on LGBTQ+ communities by the CCP government

Back in 2021, the government had begun the [**crackdown**](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-wechat-deletes-university-lgbt-accounts-2021-07-07/) on the LGBTQ+ communities by closing a number of WeChat accounts belonging to these groups.

Two years later, the crackdown has only gotten more intense. Nowadays the goverment is banning anything resembling the color composition of the [**rainbow flag**](https://time.com/6302212/china-lgbtq-concert-rainbow-ban/) at concerts. Recently on 08/22/2023, also known as *Qixi(七夕)* or the Chinese Valentine's Day, another six LGBTQ+ Wechat accounts (including those owned by the transgender and asexual communities) were [**forced to shut down**](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/renquanfazhi/gt1-08232023025803.html) by the platform.
